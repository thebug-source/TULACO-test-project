    "description": "Apple James Grieve is a fantastic dual purpose apple. The apples are juicy and tangy picked straight from the tree in early September and if left on the tree into October become a sweeter fruit. The good flavour of Apple James Grieve and the attractive red flushed skin makes this a popular variety. The flesh is not crisp but instead eats more like a firm pear. James Grieve apple trees are from Edinburgh in 1893 and so is ideal for Northern areas or less favourable sites. Pollinatation with an apple in group A, B or C within a half mile radius is required. In addition to our regular rootstocks, we offer this popular dual purpose apple tree on a very-dwarf rootstock and also as a mature tree."

    "name": "Katy",
    "description": "Apple Katy is a Swedish variety from 1947, also known as Apple Katja and produces heavy crops of bright red fruit. The flavour is sweet and sometimes strawberry-like. When picked straight from the tree Apple Katy has an incredibly juicy refreshing taste. Apple Katy is often used for juicing, with the juice being slightly dry and very refreshing. Crops of bright red apples are produced in early September. A pollinator is required in group A, B or C within a half mile radius. Apple Katy will suit less than perfect and/or Northern positions. Katy is a popular variety so we offer it in M27 rootstocks (very dwarf - ideal for growing in pots and tiny gardens) as well as our usual M26 (semi dwarf) and MM106 (semi vigorous)."

    "description": "A real treat, Scrumptious apples eat like a good crisp green apple with the strawberry flavours of tasty apples Discovery and Worcester Pearmain, and the sweetness of Golden Delicious. The juicy flavoursome flesh is also aromatic, making it a favourite with pretty-much everyone that tries it! Scrumptious Apple trees are self fertile, so you'll only need one tree and they certainly are an excellent choice if you only have space for one.  As the award-winning Scrumptious Apple is so popular, in addition to our usual M26 (semi dwarf) and MM106 (semi vigorous), we also offer it on an M27 (very dwarf) rootstock which is ideal for container planting and tiny gardens."
